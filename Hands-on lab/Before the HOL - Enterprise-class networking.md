# Enterprise-class networking in Azure before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

You must have a working Azure subscription [without a spending limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit#why-you-might-want-to-remove-the-spending-limit) to deploy the Barracuda firewall from the Azure Marketplace in order to carry out this step-by-step, hands-on lab.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine to execute the PowerShell commands in the lab

If you are working on a machine that cannot run PowerShell, carry out this task. Only do this if you are not running the commands on your local machine and are provisioning a VM to perform the steps.

1. Launch a browser, and navigate to <https://portal.azure.com>. Once prompted, login with your Microsoft Azure credentials. If asked, choose whether your account is an organization account or just a Microsoft Account.

2. Expand the portal's left navigation by clicking **Expand portal menu** on the top left. Select **+Create a resource** on the left navigation, and in the search box, type in **Visual Studio 2022**, and press enter. In the list of results, select **Visual Studio 2022**. From the drop down, select **Visual Studio 2022 Community on Windows Server 2022 (x64)**. Then select **Create**.

    ![In this screenshot, the Visual Studio 2022 Azure Marketplace option is depicted with the 'Select a software plan' dropdown menu open with the required image and Create button selected.](images/Setup/SetupVS.png "Visual Studio image selection")

3. On the **Create a virtual machine** blade, on the **Basics** tab, select the following configuration and select **Next : Disks**:

    - Subscription: **If you have multiple subscriptions, choose the subscription to execute your labs in**.

    - Resource Group: (Create new) **OPSLABRG**

    - Virtual machine name: **LABVM**

    - Region: **Choose the closest Azure region to you**.

    - Availability options: **No infrastructure redundancy required**.

    - Security: **Standard**

    - Image: **Visual Studio 2022 Community on Windows Server 2022 (x64) - Gen 1**

    - VM architecture: **x64**

    - Size: **Standard DS1 v2** or **Standard D2s v3**

    - User name: **demouser**

    - Password/Confirm password: **demo@pass123**

    - Public inbound ports: **Allow selected ports**.

    - Select inbound ports: **RDP (3389)**

    >**Note**: If the Azure Subscription you are using is **NOT** a trial Azure subscription, you may want to choose the **Standard D2s v3** to have more power in this LABVM. If you are using a Trial Subscription or one that you know has a restriction on the number of cores, stick with **Standard DS1 v2**.

4. On the **Create a virtual machine** blade, on the **Disks** tab, select the following configuration and select **Review + create**:

    - OS disk type: **Standard SSD**
    - Delete with VM: **Checked**

5. Ensure that the validation passed and select **Create**. The deployment should begin provisioning. It may take 10+ minutes for the virtual machine to complete provisioning.

    >**Note:** Please wait for the LABVM to be provisioned prior to moving to the next step.

6. Wait for deployment status of **LABVM** to complete. Once the deployment blade displays the message **Your deployment is complete**, select **Go to resource**.

7. On the **LABVM** blade, first select **Connect**, then select **RDP**, and then select **Download RDP File** to establish a Remote Desktop session.

    ![In this screenshot, the Azure portal page of the newly created virtual machine is depicted with the Connect menu expanded. The Connect button and RDP option are highlighted.](images/Setup/image13.png "Azure Portal VM page")

8. Depending on your Remote Desktop protocol client and browser configuration, you will either be prompted to open an RDP file, or you will need to download it and then open it separately to connect.

9. Log in with the credentials specified during creation:

    - User: **demouser**
